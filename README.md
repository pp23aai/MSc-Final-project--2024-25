# Automatic License Plate Recognition (ALPR) Using YOLOv11 ðŸš—

 
This project implements a YOLOv11-based model for Automatic License Plate Recognition (ALPR) using the ALPR-v1 dataset. The goal is to detect and recognize license plates in images accurately.

---

## **Project Overview**

 
*Example: License plate detection and recognition using YOLOv11.*

---

## **Dataset**

- **Name**: Alpr
- **Source**: (https://universe.roboflow.com/sezgin-koc-3z1r3/license-plates-kwudy/health)
- **Description**: The dataset contains annotated images for license plate detection, enabling robust model training and evaluation.

## **Features**

 1. Custom CNN for Licence plate detection
 2. Yolo V11 implementation
 3. Hyperparameters for better results
 4. comparative analysis of cnn and yolo v11 , which gives best results in terms of detecting the plates
 5. best model undergoes with Ocr model implementation
 6. Done Ocr models 1. Tessaract Ocr and EasyOcr
 7. plots , results are mentioned in above code
